   * Add new items with title, price, and description.
   * Upload item images directly to Supabase storage.
   * Create and manage custom menu categories on the fly.
* **Integrated Feedback**: Includes a direct link for customers to leave Google Reviews and find the cafe via a map embed.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository and install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Environment Configuration**: Create a `.env.local` file and add your Supabase credentials:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

3. **Run Development Server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the result.

## 📝 Admin Access

The administrative features are protected by a session check. The dashboard requires a `house_admin_session` to be present in the browser's session storage to view or edit menu items. Menu images are stored in a Supabase bucket titled `menu-images`.
